# Building My Cloud Resume Challenge

## Introduction

When I first heard about the Cloud Resume Challenge, I knew it was the perfect project to showcase my cloud skills and web development abilities. This post chronicles my journey from concept to deployment.

## The Challenge

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a multi-step project designed to help you build practical cloud skills. It involves:

- Creating a resume website hosted on cloud infrastructure
- Implementing serverless backend functionality
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines
- Working with Infrastructure as Code

## My Approach

I decided to use a modern tech stack that would demonstrate both my frontend and backend capabilities:

### Frontend

- **React** for the UI framework
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **CSS** for styling with a focus on responsive design

### Backend

- **Python** for serverless functions
- **JSON** for data storage (later migrated to markdown with frontmatter)

## Key Learnings

Throughout this project, I learned several valuable lessons:

1. **Infrastructure as Code is powerful**: Being able to version control your infrastructure alongside your application code is a game-changer.

2. **Serverless has its place**: For certain workloads, serverless functions provide excellent scalability without the overhead of managing servers.

3. **Documentation matters**: Writing good documentation as you build helps future you and anyone else who looks at your code.

## Challenges Faced

Not everything went smoothly. Here are some obstacles I encountered:

- **CORS issues**: Getting the frontend to communicate properly with the backend required careful configuration.
- **State management**: Deciding how to structure data and manage application state took careful planning.
- **Performance optimization**: Ensuring fast load times required optimization of assets and code splitting.

## What's Next

This project is never truly "done." I have several enhancements planned:

- Adding a blog section (currently in progress!)
- Implementing analytics to track visitors
- Adding more interactive elements
- Improving accessibility

## Conclusion

The Cloud Resume Challenge has been an incredible learning experience. It's given me hands-on experience with cloud technologies and modern web development practices. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to level up their skills.
